      "text": "**Issue Found:**\nThe `GreenScore` component crashes when receiving unexpected grade values because it tries to access styles for grades that don't exist in the `GRADE_MAP`.\n\n**Fix Implemented:**\n1. Added safe grade fallback: `grade?.toLowerCase() || 'unknown'`\n2. Added style fallback: `GRADE_MAP[normalizedGrade] ?? GRADE_MAP.unknown`\n\n**Result:**\nNow when a bad grade comes in:\n- It automatically uses the \"unknown\" style (gray background)\n- No more crashes from undefined values\n- Still shows meaningful output instead of breaking\n\n**Before:** Crash on invalid grades  \n**After:** Shows gray \"unknown\" badge for invalid grades\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2ddc31e-2957-4276-a4d3-b5401f88ddf0)\n\nif this is correct, i can make a PR."
